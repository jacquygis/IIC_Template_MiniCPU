## How it works

Based on the input information, a few operations can be used to process the input values. If there should be operations done with two or more values, store- and loading- operations have to be executed in between before going to the next calculation step.

## How to test

For example giving the CPU a value to store and next to load into the accumulator by giving the correct operation codes and the storage address.
Next giving the CPU the next value and the operation that should be processes onto those to values, for example a AND function. The result will be given to the output converted to a 8-Bit signal.
